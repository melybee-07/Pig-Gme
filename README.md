# 📖 [Pig Game] <a name="about-project"></a>

**[Pig Game]** is a JavaScript-based dice game where players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points. The goal of the game is to reach a specific score (e.g., 100) before the opponent but for my version of this game i made the score limited to 10. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# 🕹️ [How to Play] <a name="How-to-Play"></a>

**[How to Play]** The game is played by two players taking turns. On each turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as they want. The value of each roll is added to the player's current score. However, if a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to 0, and it becomes the next player's turn. The player can choose to "hold" their current score, which adds it to their total score. The first player to reach the target score wins the game.
